/// copied at most once per guard, when a reader edition of the same map is
/// still outstanding. Each partition reached through that spine is copied out
/// of structural sharing the first time it is mutated while an observer still
/// holds it -- that copy is Theta(the partition's slots) and is the larger of
/// the two whenever a partition holds more than a handful of records. When
/// nothing observes the substrate, mutation happens in place and neither copy
/// occurs.
