#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
//! Forge Harness is first-class execution infrastructure for Forge runtimes.
//!
//! It provides the stable substrate for scenario fixtures, mutation batches,
//! execution profiles, record capture, replay, event streams, comparison, and
//! harness-native tooling such as benches, run matrices, and parity suites.
//!
//! The crate is intentionally runtime-neutral. `forge-signal` is the first
//! adapter, but the contract is shaped to support relational, bridge, kernel,
//! fintech, and game-loop style runtimes without leaking runtime internals into
//! the generic harness surface.
