- `milestone5/`
  - Milestone 5 compile-fail lowered-versus-ready boundary bundle definition under `tests/ui/milestone5/compile_fail/`
  - Milestone 5 compile-pass lowered-to-ready-to-executed, checked-readiness, same-basis runtime-readmission, and shifted-basis runtime-readmission progression bundle definition under `tests/ui/milestone5/compile_pass/`
  - Milestone 5 basis/failure/transition digest derivation for lowered, bridged-lowered, readmitted-lowered, ready, shifted-basis ready, and executed recipe surfaces
  - Milestone 5 representative codegen-honesty capture for lowered, ready, executed, readiness-context, and lowered-readmission carriers
  - Milestone 5 residual-debt report derivation for representative execution-boundary closure limits

Rules:

- generic compile-fail mechanics belong under `compile_fail/`
- generic compile-pass mechanics belong under `compile_pass/`
- generic report types belong under `type_shapes/`
- generic digest vocabularies for proof-bearing surfaces belong under `proof_shapes/`
- milestone-local evidence derivation belongs under the milestone module
- no domain-specific migration pressure belongs here yet because Milestone 1
  does not ship migration suites
