# React

The React adapter subscribes components to Worth Signals state. It does not
copy that state into a second React-owned store.

## Stable Entry Points

- `createReactSignalsStore(signals)`
- `ReactSignalsStoreProvider`
- `useReactSignalsStore()`
- `useSignalValue(handle, store?)`
- `useOutputValue(handle, store?)`
- `useOptionalSignalValue(handle, store?)`
- `useSignalsDiagnostics(store?)`
- `useSignalsHistory(store?)`

Resource, form, and router hooks live in the same `worth-signals-wasm/react`
subpath.

## Create One Store

```tsx
import { createSignals } from "worth-signals-wasm";
import {
  createReactSignalsStore,
  ReactSignalsStoreProvider,
} from "worth-signals-wasm/react";

const signals = await createSignals();
const store = createReactSignalsStore(signals);

root.render(
  <ReactSignalsStoreProvider store={store}>
    <App />
  </ReactSignalsStoreProvider>,
);
```

The store adapts subscriptions and transactions. `signals` remains the state
runtime.

## Read And Write A Signal

```tsx
import { useSignalValue } from "worth-signals-wasm/react";

function QuantityEditor({ quantity }) {
  const value = useSignalValue(quantity);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => void quantity.set(value + 1)}>
      Quantity: {value}
    </button>
  );
}
```

Do not mirror `value` with `useState` and an effect. That creates two owners and
adds a race you now have to explain.

React state is still appropriate for genuinely UI-owned values such as whether
a popover is open or which diagnostic row a person selected.

## Read A Published Output

```tsx
import { useOutputValue } from "worth-signals-wasm/react";

function Total({ checkout }) {
  const total = useOutputValue(checkout.output("total"));
  return <strong>{total}</strong>;
}
```

Graph output names remain part of the published feature boundary. React does
not need to know the graph's internal handles.

## Use Your Existing Form Components

`useSignalsForm(...)` returns headless field and action bindings. Pass them to
the input components your application already owns:

```tsx
import { SubmitButton, TextInput } from "../ui/forms";

function ProfileEditor() {
  const editor = useProfileEditor();

  return (
    <form onSubmit={editor.save}>
      <TextInput label="Email" field={editor.email} />
      <SubmitButton action={editor.submit}>Save profile</SubmitButton>
    </form>
  );
}
```

Worth owns values, messages, readiness, and interaction lifecycle. Your
components own HTML, accessibility presentation, and styling. Do not copy a
binding's value into component state or perform resource I/O in the component.
See [Form API](../api-reference/forms.md) for the complete form, validation, and
hook recipe.

## Lifecycle

Create the runtime and store at an application boundary that outlives the
components using them. Free feature subscriptions when their feature unmounts.
Free the runtime only when the application is permanently done with every
handle it created.

## Anti-Patterns

- Do not mirror signal values with `useState` plus `useEffect`.
- Do not create one Signals runtime per component.
- Do not subscribe manually when a package hook already owns that lifecycle.
- Do not put application truth in React context merely to make it reachable.
