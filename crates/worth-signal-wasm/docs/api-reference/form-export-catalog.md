This page gives every public Forms declaration a short, plain-English job
description. It is an orientation map, not a substitute for the task-focused
guides or the exact TypeScript signatures.

At this time, the deeper details are discoverable in source code. Start with
the declaration file named above each group in `package/types/forms/`, then
follow its imports or implementation into `package-src/product/forms/`. The
ordinary application entry point remains `signals.form(...)`; many entries
below are report, evidence, policy, or host-integration types rather than
things an application constructs directly.

## How To Go Deeper

Use the [Form API Reference](forms.md) for the ordinary controller lane and the
[Forms overview](../forms/index.md) to choose a task-focused guide. When a
catalog entry is the only public explanation available, read its named
declaration file first. Then follow the corresponding implementation under
`package-src/product/forms/` and the evidence named in
`docs/metadata/public-surface-policy.json`.
