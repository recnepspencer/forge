//! Sealed marker authoring.
//!
//! [`AuthorityWitness::from_authority_marker`] is exactly as sealed as its
//! marker's constructor, because possession of the marker *is* the authority.
//! That contract is easy to state and easy to get wrong: a `pub struct Foo;` is
//! freely constructible by any consumer, so a witness over it proves nothing.
//!
//! These macros generate the sealed shape, so the correct pattern is the
//! default rather than something each consumer has to know.
//!
//! [`AuthorityWitness::from_authority_marker`]: crate::AuthorityWitness::from_authority_marker

/// Declare an authority marker that only its defining module can construct.
///
/// The generated type may be `pub` — it has to be nameable, since consumers
/// write `AuthorityWitness<MyAuthority>` in signatures — while its single field
/// stays private. `seal()` and `witness()` carry no visibility modifier for the
/// same reason: minting is the owner's privilege, and delegating it is a
/// decision the owner makes explicitly by writing a wrapper, never one this
/// macro makes for them.
///
/// **The exact reach of the seal:** Rust privacy admits the declaring module
/// *and its descendants*. A child module of the declarer can mint; a sibling,
/// a parent, and any other crate cannot. Declare the marker in the module that
/// owns the authority, not in a parent that happens to be convenient — nesting
/// a submodule under it grants that submodule minting rights. `tests/ui/
/// milestone2/sealed_markers_are_not_mintable_by_consumers.rs` pins the sibling
/// boundary.
