//! Type-level instance identity.
//!
//! Everything else this crate expresses is *kind*-level: `Proof` and
//! `AuthorityWitness` are `PhantomData`, so two runtimes of the same type are
//! indistinguishable. A witness proves the lane, never which instance — which
//! is why milestone 9.16 Phase 8 fell back to comparing a `u64` at run time.
//!
//! A brand closes that gap without a value. [`with_brand`] opens a scope
//! carrying a fresh, invariant lifetime; values bound inside it are
//! [`Branded`] with that lifetime, and the compiler refuses to substitute a
//! value from one scope where another scope's is expected. Rung 1: the mistake
//! is unrepresentable, and the brand costs nothing at run time.
//!
//! **Known limit — read before reaching for this.** Every use must sit inside
//! the branding scope. A brand cannot be stored in a struct that outlives the
//! `with_brand` call, so it does not fit a long-lived carrier such as a
//! runtime handle held in a registry. For those, a process-unique identity
//! *value* compared at run time is the right tool, and it belongs to the
//! runtime that owns the counter — not here. This crate has no clock and no
//! counter by design.
