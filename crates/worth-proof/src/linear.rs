//! Resource values represented once and consumed exactly once.
//!
//! Milestone 9.16 Phase 8's recovery handle is a general pattern wearing a
//! domain name: represented under an authority, reaching **exactly one** terminal
//! state, never usable afterwards. Store, UI, and Signal all have this shape,
//! and each hand-rolled it with a `live: bool` guarded at run time.
//!
//! The law is expressible without any of that. [`LinearResource::terminate`]
//! takes `self`, so a second transition is not a check that fails — it is a
//! program that does not compile.
//!
//! **What is deliberately absent.** No registry, no enumeration of live
//! resources, no `Drop` leak detection, no `assert_no_live()`. Those need a
//! live table and a clock, which this crate does not have and does not want;
//! they belong to the runtime that owns the resources. What that runtime
//! should not have to re-derive is the law itself.
//!
//! **Honest limit.** Rust has no linear types: nothing forces a caller to
//! terminate rather than drop. This module makes the *second* termination
//! unrepresentable (rung 1) and marks the resource `#[must_use]` so an ignored
//! one is a warning. Detecting a resource that was dropped without terminating
//! is a `Drop` impl, and therefore the owner's job.
