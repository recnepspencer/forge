# Enforces one policy for worth-relational CI test lanes: a named test selection
# must reach at least one test that the lane will actually execute, and is then
# executed under that exact same selection. The preflight and the execution
# share a single filter vector, so a lane can never assert one selection and
# run another.
#
# libtest's --list reports every test matching the filter regardless of its
# #[ignore] posture, but an ordinary run executes only the non-ignored ones.
# Listing alone therefore cannot prove executability: a family that became
# entirely #[ignore]d would list as present and then run nothing, reporting
# success. In ordinary posture this script subtracts the --ignored listing from
# the full listing to count what will really run. Under --ignored the listing is
# already exactly the set that executes.
#
# "At least one executable test" is the right floor for a family selection, but
# it is too weak for a lane whose claim depends on a known set of tests running
# together. Such a lane declares that set with repeated --expect-name. Every
# declared name must then answer to an executable test, and no undeclared test
# may join the selection, so a rename, a deletion or a new #[ignore] turns the
# lane red instead of quietly shrinking what it proves.
#
# Usage:
#   run_relational_named_test_selection.sh (--lib | --test <target>) \
#     --selection <filter> [--exact] [--ignored] [--features <list>] \
#     [--expect-name <exact test path>]...

prove executability on its own: --list reports ignored tests too.
