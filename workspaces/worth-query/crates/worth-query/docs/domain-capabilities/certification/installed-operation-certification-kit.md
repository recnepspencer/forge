# Installed Operation Certification Kit

## What This Feature Is

`worth-query-certification` is the cold, certification-only contract for
proving that an installed operation keeps the same meaning across admitted
providers and rejects generic authority attacks at the earliest boundary.

It owns:

- the eight domain-supplied semantic scenario families
- the complete provider-independent installed-operation journey vocabulary
- the generic hostile-attack registry
- exact denial-boundary and structural-counter evidence
- the two-provider semantic parity oracle

It does not own runtime installation and cannot mint Query authority.

## Audience Boundary

Ordinary code imports `worth-query-host`. Certification packages explicitly
allowed by the machine constitution may additionally import:

```rust
use worth_query_certification::facade::{
    certify_provider_pair,
    WorthQueryCertificationProvider,
    WorthQueryCertificationScenario,
    WorthQueryCertificationScenarioKind,
    WorthQueryCertificationSuite,
};
```

The certification crate itself depends only on the host and replay audience
facades. It does not depend on Query implementation modules. The boundary
checker rejects unlisted consumers and keeps replay cert-only.

## Domain Contribution

A downstream domain contributes a small complete suite:

```rust
let suite = WorthQueryCertificationSuite::complete([
    WorthQueryCertificationScenario::with_oracle(
        "geometry-workflow",
        WorthQueryCertificationScenarioKind::Workflow,
        [("result".to_owned(), "settled".to_owned())],
        expected_counters,
    )?,
    // replay, conditional node, correspondence, reversal, lineage,
    // dependency impact, and counter contract
])?;
```

Query owns the generic compile-fail and hostile-attack cross-product. A domain
does not reproduce those fixtures or build a product-specific evidence ledger.
Its provider adapter executes scenarios and projects results into
provider-neutral semantic facts and exact counters. Query derives and attaches
the journey checkpoints from the scenario family.

## Provider Parity

`certify_provider_pair` requires distinct provider identities, runs the same
domain suite against both, and compares each provider independently with the
domain-authored oracle:

- exact semantic facts
- exact structural counters

Query derives the generic journey checkpoints from the eight scenario
families and records them in the certification report, so providers and domains
do not reconstruct that matrix. The aggregate suite covers
operation resolution, installation, single-root entry, graph participation,
multi-domain and multi-graph binding, workflow, re-execution, replay, reversal,
publication, lineage, promotion, support, execution, consumption, native
access, impact, sharing, lease, compatibility, invalidation, collection
windows, and collection patches.

`certify_hostile_provider` is separate. Query runs its canonical hostile matrix
once through a Query-owned hostile-world adapter. Domain provider adapters do
not reproduce the generic authority attack cross-product.

## Static Enforcement

The central `trybuild` session contains a positive audience-facade journey and
focused negative proofs for real type-system guarantees. Boundary-check also
snapshots the complete nested `worth-query-host::installed` namespace, not
only the top-level `installed` module name.

Runtime-affine foreign, stale, cross-provider, lifecycle, replay, collection,
and correspondence failures remain typed runtime certification. They are not
misrepresented as generated compile tests.
