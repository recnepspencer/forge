//! Store test support — production-facade harness helpers plus named synthetic
//! courtroom authority for certification replay.
//!
//! Production admission authority lives in production crates. This crate falsifies
//! production topology through named harness modules rather than bypassing it:
//! `harness::production_facade` assembles legal production flows, while
//! `harness::test_authority` exposes courtroom-only synthetic evidence.
