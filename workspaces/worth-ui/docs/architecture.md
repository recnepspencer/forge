# Worth UI Architecture

Worth UI turns authored application meaning into a host-neutral mounted frame.
Application code chooses declarations, capabilities, and Query views. The
framework chooses and binds the host exactly once.
The platform keeps parsing, semantic observation, consequence planning,
runtime state, publication, and native mechanics in their owning layers.

Cross-family service work uses a session-owned, non-publishing proposal
compiler. It carries coherence, budgets, occupancy, cancellation, sealed owner
references, and publication-result acknowledgements only. Family successors
remain with family owners, atomic semantic/mounted publication remains with the
existing publication path, and physical settlement remains with presentation
and host-truth owners.

Proposal occupancy is indexed by active application generation and semantic
surface, then keyed by service family and owner scope. Ordinary reserve work
does not walk sibling semantic neighborhoods; a scalar live count guards the
bounded table. The exact generation-and-surface index shape is compile-tested;
the zero unrelated-neighborhood counter is not accepted as its own oracle. The
before-effect window closes only when the first sealed owner witness is
accepted. Runtime shutdown abandons still-open work, returns a typed recoverable
blocker for witnessed owner work, and never treats silence as terminal success.

## Source To Mounted Flow

```text
file source or typed Rust authoring
-> worth-ui-dsl compile and canonical semantic package
-> declared scalar or collection projection requirements
-> candidate submission
-> application preparation
-> installed Query projection registration where declared
-> graph admission and planning
-> active application session
-> Query-issued projection observation through ordinary rebind
-> mounted frame assembly
-> runtime-issued initial, delta, or unchanged presentation work
-> host-contract presentation
-> publication or a typed non-success outcome
```

File transport and language meaning are separate. Runtime reads and watches
files, then carries one settled snapshot into one DSL compile. Typed Rust input
enters the semantic compiler directly. Runtime preparation consumes the sealed
package; it never reparses source on a steady frame.

## Observation To Rebind Flow

```text
owner-specific source / host / measurement / Query / committed-runtime evidence
-> admitted observation turn
-> semantic classification
-> produced facts + declared consumed aspects
-> indexed affected scope
-> identity lifecycle
-> immutable rebind plan
-> final admission and reservation
-> canonical host effects
-> one atomic semantic + mounted publication
```

This is a state-change compiler, not an event callback. Each governed phase
requires the concrete value issued by the previous owner. A watcher, pixel,
digest, inspection receipt, or host result cannot construct a plan or publish.

## Interaction To Consequence Flow

```text
loss-aware host observations
-> presented-target gesture or bounded draft lifecycle
-> semantic interaction
-> typed route + coherent payload + operability proof
-> optional affine confirmation
-> move-only UI admission
-> destination-specific provider execution
-> separate product or Query admission
-> declared consequence
-> ordinary observation/rebind/mounted publication
```

Interaction state owns targeting and input continuity. Intent admission owns
route, payload, operability, confirmation, concurrency, and bounded admission
slots. Intent execution owns versioned providers, attempts, terminal posture,
and recovery. None of those owners can mint Query or domain authority; the
product action crosses that boundary separately and returns an owner-issued
consequence receipt.

Application effects use the exact registered `UiIntentExecutionProvider<I>`.
UI transitions use their typed transition destination. Runtime-service intent
definitions use the shipped `OpenPortal`, `ClosePortal`, or `InvokeCommand`
destination. All three reuse the same upstream semantic interaction and
admission contracts.

## Runtime-Service Flow

```text
admitted intent, host observation, rebind, policy, or continuation
-> exact family request basis
-> Portal | Focus | Motion | Command Routing | Scroll | Selection owner
-> family-owned staged successor and typed cross-owner requirements
-> non-publishing proposal compiler for coherent multi-family work
-> existing atomic application + mounted publication
-> derived presentation work
-> existing host settlement and reconciliation when an effect escapes
```

The common request basis carries identity, currentness, origin, cancellation,
budget, and concrete origin authority. It does not erase a family request into
a generic payload. Every family keeps its own state, lifecycle, request,
receipt, rebind law, and cost.

Portal emits Focus and Motion requirements rather than calling those owners.
Focus may emit one Scroll reveal requirement. Command Routing reads only the
focus and selection axes declared by the route, then emits a `CommandRoute`
source receipt back into ordinary intent admission. The proposal compiler
orders sealed owner stages but retains no family successor, publishes no fact,
and issues no host effect.

Motion truth and presentation sampling are deliberately separate. The Motion
owner derives a committed track from the exact committed predecessor and a
planning-issued prepared successor. Presentation consumes that track and Tick
to derive the current sampled geometry. Layout and rebind use committed target
geometry; hit testing, clipping, portal anchoring, and damage use the current
sample.

## Authority Owners

- `worth-ui-dsl` owns syntax, source structure, diagnostics, normalization, and
  the sealed semantic package.
- `worth-ui` owns the named product facades developers import.
- `worth-ui-runtime` owns active application, observation, rebind planning,
  semantic interaction, intent admission and managed execution, mounted
  publication, host exchange, recovery, runtime inspection, and six sibling
  service owners. Its proposal compiler coordinates those owners without
  becoming a seventh owner or publisher.
- `worth-ui-query-binding` translates installed Worth Query audience products
  into shape-specific Worth UI registrations, observations, and affine facts.
  Application declarations enter through `worth-query-decl`; hosted
  progression enters through `worth-query-host`. Runtime consumes the resulting
  UI facts and does not recreate Query.
- `worth-ui-host-contract` defines inert host capabilities, mounted input, and
  mechanical outcomes, including exact affinity, total order, logical damage,
  transparent surface baseline, window-focus and rich scroll observations,
  narrow semantic-focus placement, and structural/physical cost vocabulary.
- Native and headless host consumers perform mechanics. They never receive source, Query,
  graph, semantic-classification, or publication authority.
- `worth-ui-native-platform` owns the move-only native platform binding and
  effect-free application preparation, then exclusively enters the qualified
  native event loop after preparation succeeds.
- `worth-ui-certification` proves boundaries and may consume
  `worth-query-replay` when Query reconstruction is required; neither is an
  ordinary application API.

An identity or digest can explain what happened. It cannot launch an
application, execute a plan, publish a frame, or reconstruct authority.

## Dependency Direction

```text
application code
-> worth-ui facade
-> worth-ui-runtime
-> worth-ui-query-binding
-> worth-ui-host-contract <- native/headless mechanics

application Query entry
-> worth-query-decl / worth-query-host
-> installed Query audience product
-> worth-ui-query-binding
```

The arrows do not permit every lower layer to import every peer. Authored
meaning flows from DSL to runtime. Query crosses through its audience facades
and then the binding crate. Runtime sends sealed mounted mechanics to the host
contract. Host consumers depend on the host contract and never on runtime
internals.

The current raw `worth-query` dependency in `worth-ui-query-binding` is a
temporarily admitted predecessor edge, not this destination contract. New work
must not widen it; the binding owner must remove the remaining raw-engine
imports so `worth-query-decl` and `worth-query-host` are its only ordinary
Query audiences before broader Query-facing capabilities land.

The ordinary host lane is receipt-keyed work, not a complete projection:

```text
runtime retained presentation state
-> Initial(commands + total order + damage + baseline)
-> Delta(changes + order edits + damage + optional auxiliary successor)
-> Unchanged(exact predecessor/successor affinity, zero work)
```

Candidates become retained host truth only after every required surface
settles successfully. Partial or uncertain effects cannot promote them.

Within runtime, graph does not depend on mounting; observation cannot publish;
rebind planning cannot mutate mounted truth; inspection cannot mutate or
reconstruct operational state. The active session coordinates complete
transitions across named owners.

Projection fact flow is deliberately one-way:

```text
Query owner
-> worth-query-decl / worth-query-host audience boundary
-> worth-ui-query-binding
-> owner-specific UI observation
-> ordinary rebind planning
-> mounted semantic text
-> host-contract mechanics
```

The active session owns no Query result cache. A published fact returns through
its affine completion to the Query lifecycle owner; reporting identities do not
form a reverse authority edge.

## Failure And Publication

Preparation, observation admission, classification, planning, final admission,
mounting, host presentation, and publication have different denial owners. A
denial before effects preserves the prior published generation and frame.

Candidate work remains off to the side until application, graph, plan,
allocation, mounted identity, and frame can publish as one coherent successor.
If native effects may have started, runtime retains the previous semantic
publication and exact recovery authority; it never reports optimistic rollback.

`UiRebindRuntimeState` owns plan, receipt, completion, recovery, terminal
decision, and causal-evidence capacity. Canonical cutover still occurs through
the application and mounted publication owners—there is no watcher-owned or
renderer-owned alternate. Intent outcomes enter this path only as declared,
owner-admitted consequences; provider completion cannot publish by itself.

## Cost Posture

Source acquisition and DSL compilation are reconstructive source work. Steady
frames operate from the active sealed generation. Post-classification rebind
work is reported as `O + F + A + C + R + G + M + B`: observations, facts,
affected consumers, conflicts, resets, graph work, mounted work, and retained
bookkeeping. Physical presentation/reconciliation remains a separate host cost.

Changed-frame work follows declared consumers and derived indexes. Unchanged
publication uses exact reuse evidence and performs no new rebind work. Rich
inspection and causal reports are materialized outside measured execution when
requested.

Semantic text is complete before the host boundary. Host adapters receive
mounted text and presentation mechanics, never a Query view, field selector,
projection receipt, or instruction to fetch product data.

## Extension Boundaries

New product data, intents, appearance facts, expressions,
and authored composition extend their semantic owner and feed the existing
observation/planning/publication progression. They must not add a universal
event bag, a second executor, or a host-adapter semantic lane.

Portal, focus, motion, command-routing, scroll, and selection successors extend
their existing family owner and public declaration contracts. They must not add
service-to-service calls, mutable runtime owners to the facade, or a second
publication/host-settlement path.

Runtime service routing remains UI authority. A routed command may request a
separately admitted Query application operation, but its UI receipt cannot
authorize that operation. Undo and redo remain unsupported until their owning
operation runtime publishes governed history and execution capability.
